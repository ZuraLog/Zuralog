Successfully installed and configured Vercel Web Analytics for the Next.js project.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Package Installation
- Installed `@vercel/analytics` package using npm
- Package version added to dependencies in package.json
- Updated package-lock.json with new dependencies (466 packages added)

### 2. Code Integration
Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/next"`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the `<body>` tag, placed after the `<Toaster />` component
- This follows the recommended pattern for App Router projects

### 3. Implementation Details
The Analytics component was strategically placed:
- Inside the root layout's body tag
- After the Toaster component (for toast notifications)
- Before the closing body tag
- This ensures analytics tracking is active across all pages of the application

### 4. Verification
- Linter was run to ensure no new errors were introduced
- TypeScript compilation checked (no errors related to our changes)
- The Analytics component is now properly integrated and will track page views and web vitals when deployed to Vercel

## Files Staged:
- package.json (added @vercel/analytics dependency)
- package-lock.json (updated with new package dependencies)
- src/app/layout.tsx (imported and added Analytics component)

## Notes:
- The project uses npm as the package manager
- This is an App Router project (using the `app` directory)
- The Analytics component will automatically start tracking once the application is deployed to Vercel
- No additional configuration is required for basic web analytics functionality
