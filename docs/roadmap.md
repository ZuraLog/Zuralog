## Phase 9.5 — Settings Mapping Audit & Today Tab Wiring (`feat/today-tab-settings-wiring`)

> **Branch:** `feat/today-tab-settings-wiring` → merged to main (2026-03-08)

Completed 4 tasks from the Settings Mapping Audit plan, wiring persisted user preferences to the Today tab and Quick Log.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Task 3.1: Greeting personalization (Bug fix) | ✅ Done | `_timeOfDayGreeting()` now shows "Good morning, Alex" using `profile?.aiName`; falls back gracefully to "Good morning" if no name available |
| P0 | Task 3.2: Data Maturity Banner dismiss persistence | ✅ Done | Banner dismiss writes to persisted `userPreferencesProvider` via `mutate()`; progress mode `onDismiss` and stillBuilding `onPermanentDismiss` both persist; session X-dismiss on stillBuilding remains session-only (intentional); dead session-scoped `dataMaturityBannerDismissed` StateProvider removed; `showBanner` logic gates on both `!bannerDismissed` AND `!prefsAsync.isLoading` (prevents race condition) |
| P0 | Task 3.3: Wellness Check-in card gated on Privacy toggle | ✅ Done | `_WellnessCheckinCard` wrapped in `if (wellnessCardVisible)`; reads `wellnessCheckinCardVisibleProvider` (persisted via `userPreferencesProvider`); Privacy & Data screen's "Wellness Check-in" toggle now controls Today tab card visibility |
| P0 | Task 3.4: Units-aware water label in Quick Log | ✅ Done | Added `UnitsSystemWaterLabel` extension to `user_preferences_model.dart` — `waterUnitLabel` getter returns `'glasses (250 ml)'` for metric, `'glasses (8 oz)'` for imperial; `_WaterCounter` now has `required String label`; receives `unitsSystem.waterUnitLabel`; backend `waterGlasses` payload unchanged |

---

## Phase 9.6 — Settings Mapping Audit: Data Tab Wiring (`feat/data-tab-settings-wiring`)

> **Branch:** `feat/data-tab-settings-wiring` → merged to main (2026-03-08)

Completed all 3 Data tab actions from the Settings Mapping Audit plan.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Task 4.1: Appearance Settings category color section | ✅ Done | Pre-existing — section was already removed. `appearance_settings_screen.dart` has no disconnected local provider; category colors are managed canonically via Data tab edit mode. |
| P1 | Task 4.2: Wire `units_system` to Metric Detail value display | ✅ Done | Created `unit_converter.dart` shared domain utility; `metric_detail_screen.dart` now reads `unitsSystemProvider` and passes display unit to all value-rendering widgets; named constants for raw table row cap and coach prefill cap |
| P2 | Task 4.3: Propagate category color overrides to Category Detail screen | ✅ Done | Both `category_detail_screen.dart` and `metric_detail_screen.dart` now read `dashboardLayoutProvider.categoryColorOverrides` via `.select()` and apply user-defined color overrides with `!= 0` guard; `_MetricChartCard` in category detail also receives display unit |

---

## Phase 9.7 — Settings Mapping Audit: Progress Tab Wiring (`feat/progress-tab-units-wiring`)

> **Branch:** `feat/progress-tab-units-wiring` → merged to main (2026-03-08)

Completed both P1 Progress tab actions from the Settings Mapping Audit plan, wiring `units_system` to the Progress tab's goal display and goal creation form.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P1 | Wire `units_system` to goal default unit pre-fill | ✅ Done | `goal_create_edit_sheet.dart`: `_defaultUnitFor(GoalType.weightTarget)` returns `'lbs'` for imperial, `'kg'` for metric via `ref.read(unitsSystemProvider)`. All other goal types are unit-system-agnostic and unchanged. |
| P1 | Wire `units_system` to goal display formatting | ✅ Done | `goals_screen.dart`, `goal_detail_screen.dart`, `progress_home_screen.dart`: all goal unit labels and WoW metric unit labels now go through `displayUnit(x.unit, unitsSystem)` from the shared `unit_converter.dart` utility. `_GoalCard` and `_WoWMetricRow` converted to `ConsumerWidget`. |

---

## Phase 10 — Engagement & Polish (`feat/engagement-polish`)

> **Branch:** `feat/engagement-polish` → squash merged to `main`

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |

> **Branch:** `feat/coach-tab-full-ai` → merged to main (2026-03-09)

All 6 Coach tab AI conversation features implemented and reviewed.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Stop Generation Button | ✅ Done | Red stop button replaces spinner during streaming; `cancelStream()` commits partial content or shows `'_Generation stopped._'` placeholder; WebSocket cleanly closed on cancel |
| P0 | Regenerate / Retry Last Response | ✅ Done | "Regenerate" button below last AI message; re-sends last user message without duplicate DB insert; reads user's actual persona/proactivity settings |
| P0 | Copy Message (Long-press) | ✅ Done | Long-press any bubble → bottom sheet with "Copy" action; clipboard write awaited; correct `ScaffoldMessenger` handling |
| P0 | Message Editing | ✅ Done | Long-press user message → "Edit" in bottom sheet; truncates messages from that index; snapshot-and-restore on cancel; editing indicator bar above input |
| P0 | Better Empty State & Suggestions | ✅ Done | `_CoachEmptyState` with fade-in, pulsing logo, "What I can do" capability row, grouped suggestion cards with 4px left colored border and category headers |
