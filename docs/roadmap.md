## Phase 9.5 — Settings Mapping Audit & Today Tab Wiring (`feat/today-tab-settings-wiring`)

> **Branch:** `feat/today-tab-settings-wiring` → merged to main (2026-03-08)

Completed 4 tasks from the Settings Mapping Audit plan, wiring persisted user preferences to the Today tab and Quick Log.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Task 3.1: Greeting personalization (Bug fix) | ✅ Done | `_timeOfDayGreeting()` now shows "Good morning, Alex" using `profile?.aiName`; falls back gracefully to "Good morning" if no name available |
| P0 | Task 3.2: Data Maturity Banner dismiss persistence | ✅ Done | Banner dismiss writes to persisted `userPreferencesProvider` via `mutate()`; progress mode `onDismiss` and stillBuilding `onPermanentDismiss` both persist; session X-dismiss on stillBuilding remains session-only (intentional); dead session-scoped `dataMaturityBannerDismissed` StateProvider removed; `showBanner` logic gates on both `!bannerDismissed` AND `!prefsAsync.isLoading` (prevents race condition) |
| P0 | Task 3.3: Wellness Check-in card gated on Privacy toggle | ✅ Done | `_WellnessCheckinCard` wrapped in `if (wellnessCardVisible)`; reads `wellnessCheckinCardVisibleProvider` (persisted via `userPreferencesProvider`); Privacy & Data screen's "Wellness Check-in" toggle now controls Today tab card visibility |
| P0 | Task 3.4: Units-aware water label in Quick Log | ✅ Done | Added `UnitsSystemWaterLabel` extension to `user_preferences_model.dart` — `waterUnitLabel` getter returns `'glasses (250 ml)'` for metric, `'glasses (8 oz)'` for imperial; `_WaterCounter` now has `required String label`; receives `unitsSystem.waterUnitLabel`; backend `waterGlasses` payload unchanged |

---

## Phase 9.6 — Settings Mapping Audit: Data Tab Wiring (`feat/data-tab-settings-wiring`)

> **Branch:** `feat/data-tab-settings-wiring` → merged to main (2026-03-08)

Completed all 3 Data tab actions from the Settings Mapping Audit plan.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Task 4.1: Appearance Settings category color section | ✅ Done | Pre-existing — section was already removed. `appearance_settings_screen.dart` has no disconnected local provider; category colors are managed canonically via Data tab edit mode. |
| P1 | Task 4.2: Wire `units_system` to Metric Detail value display | ✅ Done | Created `unit_converter.dart` shared domain utility; `metric_detail_screen.dart` now reads `unitsSystemProvider` and passes display unit to all value-rendering widgets; named constants for raw table row cap and coach prefill cap |
| P2 | Task 4.3: Propagate category color overrides to Category Detail screen | ✅ Done | Both `category_detail_screen.dart` and `metric_detail_screen.dart` now read `dashboardLayoutProvider.categoryColorOverrides` via `.select()` and apply user-defined color overrides with `!= 0` guard; `_MetricChartCard` in category detail also receives display unit |

---

## Phase 9.7 — Settings Mapping Audit: Progress Tab Wiring (`feat/progress-tab-units-wiring`)

> **Branch:** `feat/progress-tab-units-wiring` → merged to main (2026-03-08)

Completed both P1 Progress tab actions from the Settings Mapping Audit plan, wiring `units_system` to the Progress tab's goal display and goal creation form.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P1 | Wire `units_system` to goal default unit pre-fill | ✅ Done | `goal_create_edit_sheet.dart`: `_defaultUnitFor(GoalType.weightTarget)` returns `'lbs'` for imperial, `'kg'` for metric via `ref.read(unitsSystemProvider)`. All other goal types are unit-system-agnostic and unchanged. |
| P1 | Wire `units_system` to goal display formatting | ✅ Done | `goals_screen.dart`, `goal_detail_screen.dart`, `progress_home_screen.dart`: all goal unit labels and WoW metric unit labels now go through `displayUnit(x.unit, unitsSystem)` from the shared `unit_converter.dart` utility. `_GoalCard` and `_WoWMetricRow` converted to `ConsumerWidget`. |

| P0 | Regenerate / Retry Last Response | ✅ Done | "Regenerate" button below last AI message; re-sends last user message without duplicate DB insert; reads user's actual persona/proactivity settings |
| P0 | Copy Message (Long-press) | ✅ Done | Long-press any bubble → bottom sheet with "Copy" action; clipboard write awaited; correct `ScaffoldMessenger` handling |
| P0 | Message Editing | ✅ Done | Long-press user message → "Edit" in bottom sheet; truncates messages from that index; snapshot-and-restore on cancel; editing indicator bar above input |
| P0 | Better Empty State & Suggestions | ✅ Done | `_CoachEmptyState` with fade-in, pulsing logo, "What I can do" capability row, grouped suggestion cards with 4px left colored border and category headers |
| P0 | Search Conversations | ✅ Done | `_ConversationDrawer` gets `AnimatedSize` search field; client-side filtering by title and preview; empty-results state |

| P0 | Fix missing `archived`/`deleted_at` columns in production DB | ✅ Done | `ALTER TABLE conversations ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` run directly against production Supabase |
| P0 | Fix new-conversation stale history bug (`chat_thread_screen.dart`, `coach_providers.dart`) | ✅ Done | `seedFromPrior()` added to `CoachChatNotifier`; called before `replaceNamed()` to prevent redundant `loadHistory()` call |
| P1 | Fix backend tests for streaming protocol | ✅ Done | `test_ws_connect_and_echo` and `test_ws_empty_message_returns_error` updated to match `conversation_init` → `stream_token` → `stream_end` protocol; LLM mock updated to use `stream_chat` async generator |
| P1 | Add `make uninstall`, `make reinstall`, `make reinstall-prod` targets | ✅ Done | Ensures old APK is removed before reinstall; required because `flutter run --release` does not uninstall stale APKs |

---

## Phase 10.7 — Coach Chat UX Polish (`feat/coach-chat-ux-improvements`)

> **Branch:** `feat/coach-chat-ux-improvements` — in progress

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|

## Phase 10.10 — Empty State & Zero-Data UX (`feat/empty-state-improvements`)

> **Branch:** `feat/empty-state-improvements` — merged to main 2026-03-11

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Today tab — Health Score zero state | ✅ Done | Muted ring + heart icon + "Your health score awaits" headline + two tappable action rows (Log mood/energy → QuickLogSheet; Connect app → Settings > Integrations) |
| P0 | Today tab — Insights empty state | ✅ Done | `_EmptyInsightsCard` with "Insights on the way" copy and same two action rows |
| P0 | Data tab — Score trend chart empty state | ✅ Done | `_ScoreChartEmptyState` with chart icon + friendly message inside sparkline area |

| P0 | Never-error provider pattern | ✅ Done | All 4 providers (`healthScoreProvider`, `todayFeedProvider`, `dashboardProvider`, `trendsHomeProvider`) catch all errors and return empty data objects — UI never sees an error branch |
| P0 | Shared `HealthScoreZeroState` widget | ✅ Done | Extracted to `lib/shared/widgets/health_score_zero_state.dart`; used by TodayFeedScreen card body |
| P0 | Layout fix — compact zero ring in ScoreTrendHero | ✅ Done | `_CompactScoreZeroState` (48×48 muted ring) replaces full `HealthScoreZeroState` in row slot; prevents row layout break |

## Phase 11.5 — Pre-Tester Stability & Bug Audit (fix/pre-tester-cleanup, 2026-03-13)

> **Branch:** `fix/pre-tester-cleanup` → merged to main (2026-03-13)

Comprehensive bug audit and fix pass across backend and Flutter. All tabs now query correctly, no crashes on network failures, zero `flutter analyze` issues. App is stable and ready for pre-tester onboarding.

### Backend Fixes

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Add `GET /api/v1/trends/metrics` endpoint | ✅ Done | Returns available metrics for trend analysis |
| P0 | Add `GET /api/v1/trends/correlations` endpoint | ✅ Done | Returns correlation data for Trends tab |
| P0 | Add `GET /api/v1/progress/weekly-report` endpoint | ✅ Done | Returns weekly report data for Progress tab |
| P0 | Create `GET /api/v1/data-sources` endpoint (new route file) | ✅ Done | New route file + registered in main.py |

### Flutter Fixes

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Fix Today tab quick actions JSON key (`items` → `actions`) | ✅ Done | Quick actions now appear correctly on Today screen |
| P0 | Add error-safe fallback to 6 providers | ✅ Done | `notificationsProvider`, `coachPromptSuggestionsProvider`, `coachQuickActionsProvider`, `availableMetricsProvider`, `reportsProvider`, `dataSourcesProvider` |
| P0 | Fix 8 crash sites in pull-to-refresh handlers | ✅ Done | Dart `catchError` signature corrected; app no longer crashes on network failures |
| P0 | Fix raw error message in journal screen error state | ✅ Done | Users no longer see raw error text |
| P0 | Fix explicit `dataDays: 0` in health score fallback | ✅ Done | Prevents incorrect banner appearing after failed refresh |

**Result:** All tabs query correctly, zero crashes on network failures, `flutter analyze` reports zero issues. App is stable and ready for pre-tester onboarding.

## Phase 11 — Real Data Wiring (fix/remove-mock-data-wire-real-apis, 2026-03-11)

> **Branch:** `fix/remove-mock-data-wire-real-apis` → merged to main (2026-03-11, fast-forward)

Removed all debug-mode mock gates and wired the entire Flutter app to real backend APIs. The app now always fetches live data in both debug and release builds.

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|-------|
| P0 | Remove `kDebugMode` mock gates from all 5 feature tab providers | ✅ Done | Today, Data, Coach, Trends, Progress tabs now always use real API repositories. Mock repositories preserved in codebase for test use only. |
| P0 | Remove hardcoded 'mock-user' ID from Analytics Repository | ✅ Done | Removed misleading `const String _mockUserId = 'mock-user'` query parameter. Backend reads user from JWT. Added `invalidateAll()` method for logout cleanup. |
| P0 | Wire Integrations Hub to real backend status endpoints | ✅ Done | `loadIntegrations()` fetches real connection status from `/status` endpoints for all 5 OAuth providers (Strava, Fitbit, Oura, Polar, Withings) in parallel. `disconnect()` calls backend `DELETE /disconnect` endpoints. Added `getProviderStatus()` and `disconnectProvider()` to OAuthRepository. |
| P0 | Rewrite Settings > Integrations screen to use live server data | ✅ Done | Removed 100% hardcoded duplicate model classes. Screen now reads from `integrationsProvider` (live server data). Connect/disconnect buttons trigger real OAuth flows. |
| P0 | Comprehensive logout cleanup | ✅ Done | New `_clearUserState()` method clears: (a) user-specific SharedPreferences keys, (b) all repository in-memory caches via `invalidateAll()`, (c) all Riverpod providers across every tab. Prevents User A's data from leaking to User B on the same device. |
| P0 | Code review fixes | ✅ Done | Fixed OAuth `connect()` prematurely marking integrations as "connected" (now stays in "syncing" until deep-link callback confirms). Fixed parallel fetch, UTC time comparison, added notificationsProvider to cleanup, added mounted guard on navigator pop. |

**Key decisions:**
- Device-local integrations (Apple Health, Health Connect) correctly use SharedPreferences. Server-side OAuth integrations (Strava, Fitbit, Oura, Polar, Withings) query the backend.
- Mock repositories preserved in the codebase for test use, but no longer used at runtime.
- The "never-error" provider pattern (established in Phase 10.10) was preserved — providers still catch errors and return empty data.
