# Zuralog — App Launch Checklist

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Status:** Ready for Execution

---

## Introduction

This document serves as the comprehensive launch checklist for the Zuralog mobile application. It covers all critical preparation work required before launching on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, including app store optimization, website preparation, search engine optimization, marketing activities, and legal compliance.

For a health-focused AI assistant like Zuralog—where users entrust sensitive personal health data—there are additional considerations beyond typical app launches. This checklist accounts for the unique requirements of health applications, including HealthKit and Health Connect permissions, HIPAA-compliant data handling, and the trust factors that influence user adoption in the health technology space.

---

## 1. App Store Stuff

The App Store presence is your first impression on potential users. For Zuralog, the challenge is communicating complex AI capabilities in a way that feels accessible and trustworthy. Health apps face higher scrutiny from reviewers, so precision in metadata and compliance documentation is essential.

### 1.1 App Title with Keywords

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
The app title is the most prominent element in search results and should balance brand identity with discoverable keywords. Apple and Google both index app titles, subtitles, and descriptions for search. For Zuralog, the title should clearly communicate the core value proposition while including relevant keywords that potential users would search for.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
The title "Zuralog" is distinctive and memorable, but consider whether a subtitle or keyword variant might improve discoverability. Research keywords in the health, fitness, AI, and personal assistant categories. Terms like "AI Health Coach," "Fitness Tracker," "Health Assistant," and "Activity Tracker" are competitive but relevant. The title field allows up to 30 characters on the App Store, so there is room for "Zuralog" plus a brief descriptor if needed.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Run keyword research using App Store optimization tools
- Check that the title is not trademarked by competitors
- Ensure the title reads naturally and is easy to pronounce
- Test different title variations with A/B testing if possible

### 1.2 Subtitle

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
The subtitle appears directly below the app title in search results and is another key indexing opportunity. Apple allows 30 characters; Google Play allows 50 characters. This is prime real estate for communicating your value proposition and including additional keywords that did not fit in the title.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
For Zuralog, an effective subtitle might communicate the AI-powered nature of the app while hinting at the integration capabilities. Examples to consider:

- "AI Health Assistant" — Direct and clear
- "Your Fitness Command Center" — Value-focused
- "Connect Apps. Get Insights." — Feature-focused
- "Smart Health Tracker" — Simple and accessible

The subtitle should complement the title rather than repeat it. If the title emphasizes the brand, the subtitle should emphasize the benefit.

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Include 2-3 high-value keywords naturally
- Focus on user benefit over features
- A/B test different subtitles if the platform supports it
- Ensure the subtitle makes sense stand-alone if the title is truncated

### 1.3 App Description

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
The app description is your opportunity to tell your complete story. The first two lines are critical—they appear in search results before the "more" button is clicked. Apple allows 4,000 characters; Google Play allows 4,000 characters. The description should be scannable with clear formatting, bullet points, and emphasis on benefits.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
The first two lines must hook the user immediately. For Zuralog, the hook should address a pain point that users feel—fragmentation across health apps—and offer the solution. Something like:

"Stop juggling multiple health apps. Zuralog connects your fitness apps and uses AI to give you personalized health insights and coaching."

This immediately communicates the problem (fragmentation) and the solution (AI-powered integration).

The body of the description should follow a structured format:

1. **Problem Statement** (first paragraph): Acknowledge the fragmentation problem users face
2. **Solution Overview** (2-3 sentences): Explain what Zuralog does
3. **Key Features** (bulleted list): Highlight the most compelling capabilities
4. **Social Proof** (if available): Mention user testimonials, press mentions, or achievements
5. **Trust Indicators** (closing): Reference privacy, security, and support

**Feature Highlights to Emphasize for Zuralog:**

- Connects with Apple Health, Google Health Connect, Strava, Fitbit, and Oura
- AI-powered conversational interface for logging and insights
- Cross-app reasoning that answers complex health questions
- Voice input for hands-free logging
- "Tough Love Coach" persona for accountability
- Privacy-first approach with on-device processing

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Include relevant keywords naturally throughout
- Update description regularly with new features
- Localize description for key markets (see localization checklist)
- Review against App Store Review Guidelines for health apps

### 1.4 Keywords Researched and Added

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
Keywords determine your discoverability in app store search. Apple uses a dedicated 100-character keyword field (comma or pipeline separated, no spaces). Google Play uses the title, short description, and long description collectively for indexing. Thorough keyword research is essential for organic discovery.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
For a health AI assistant, keyword research should cover multiple intent categories:

**Category 1: Health & Fitness**
- health tracker, fitness tracker, workout tracker, activity tracker, step counter, sleep tracker, weight tracker, nutrition tracker, calorie tracker

**Category 2: AI & Smart Features**
- AI assistant, AI coach, smart assistant, voice assistant, AI health, chatbot

**Category 3: Integrations & Connectivity**
- Apple Health, Google Fit, Strava, Fitbit, Oura, health app integration, sync apps

**Category 4: Problem-Solving**
- fitness apps, health dashboard, health insights, wellness app, habit tracker

**Category 5: Competitor Names (for visibility)**
- MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, Noom, Weight Watchers, WHOOP (use carefully)

**Keyword Research Process:**
1. Use tools like Sensor Tower, AppTweak, or App Annie
2. Analyze competitor app keywords
3. Check search volume and competition difficulty
4. Test long-tail keywords (3+ words) for lower competition
5. Group keywords by relevance and search intent

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Keywords should be single words or short phrases
- Do not repeat words already in title or subtitle
- Regionalize keywords for different markets
- Review and update keywords quarterly

### 1.5 Screenshots

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
Screenshots are your visual advertisement. Users browse screenshot galleries to understand the app experience. Apple allows up to 10 screenshots per locale; Google Play allows up to 8. Screenshots should showcase real functionality, emphasize benefits over features, and guide users through the value journey.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
For Zuralog, screenshots should tell a visual story that communicates the app's value proposition. The golden rule: show benefits, not features. Instead of showing "Chat Interface" (feature), show "Ask your health coach anything" (benefit).

**Recommended Screenshot Sequence:**

**Screenshot 1: The Problem Solver**
- Visual: Chat interface showing a user asking "Why am I not losing weight?"
- Overlay Text: "Get answers that connect the dots"
- Purpose: Immediately communicate the AI reasoning capability

**Screenshot 2: Connected Ecosystem**
- Visual: Integrations hub showing Apple Health, Strava, Fitbit, Oura connected
- Overlay Text: "One app. All your data."
- Purpose: Show the integration value proposition

**Screenshot 3: Voice Convenience**
- Visual: Voice input in action with microphone button highlighted
- Overlay Text: "Just talk to log your workout"
- Purpose: Communicate hands-free convenience

**Screenshot 4: Dashboard Overview**
- Visual: Health dashboard with activity rings, nutrition summary, AI insight card
- Overlay Text: "Your health at a glance"
- Purpose: Show the unified data view

**Screenshot 5: Coach Persona**
- Visual: Chat showing the "Tough Love Coach" response
- Overlay Text: "Accountable coaching that pushes you"
- Purpose: Differentiate with personality

**Screenshot 6: Privacy Trust**
- Visual: Privacy settings screen emphasizing local processing
- Overlay Text: "Your data stays on your device"
- Purpose: Address privacy concerns for health data

**Technical Requirements:**

- iPhone 6.7" screenshots (1290 x 2792): Primary display size
- iPhone 5.5" screenshots (1242 x 2208): Legacy device support
- Tablet screenshots (if applicable): 12.9" iPad Pro (2048 x 2732)
- Google Play: 16:9 or 9:16 aspect ratios accepted

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Use real device frames for professionalism
- Include localized text for each market
- Test screenshots on actual devices for readability
- Update screenshots when adding significant features

### 1.6 App Preview Video

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** High

**Description:**  
The app preview video plays automatically in the store listing (muted by default on Apple, configurable on Google). Videos are optional but highly recommended—they increase conversion rates significantly. Apple allows 30 seconds; Google Play allows 30 seconds (or up to 2 minutes for feature graphics).

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
The video should demonstrate the core value proposition in the first 3 seconds. For Zuralog, the video should show the AI conversation as the primary interaction, then quickly reveal the integration ecosystem.

**Recommended Video Structure (30 seconds):**

- **0-3 seconds:** Hook — User asks "How did I sleep last week?" to a sleeping figure
- **3-10 seconds:** AI Response — Screen shows AI providing sleep analysis from Oura data
- **10-18 seconds:** Cross-App — User asks "Did my running affect my sleep?" — AI connects Strava activity with sleep data
- **18-24 seconds:** Action — User says "Log my lunch" — AI logs to Health Connect
- **24-30 seconds:** Close — "Zuralog — Your AI Health Command Center" with download CTA

**Production Tips:**  
- Use screen recordings from actual app (not simulators for authenticity)
- Add text overlays for key points
- Use royalty-free music that matches tone (professional but approachable)
- Include captions for silent playback
- Create landscape version for Google Play featured sections

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Hire professional video editor if budget allows
- Create regional versions with native speakers if localizing
- A/B test with/without video if platform supports
- Keep file size under 100MB for faster downloads

### 1.7 Privacy Policy URL

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
Both Apple and Google require a publicly accessible privacy policy URL in the app store listing. For health applications, the privacy policy is especially critical—it builds trust and is required for compliance with various regulations. The policy must be hosted on a domain you control.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
Zuralog handles sensitive health data, so the privacy policy must be comprehensive and transparent. The policy should address:

**Data Collection Section:**
- What data is collected (health metrics, app usage, device information)
- How data is collected (HealthKit, Health Connect, direct input, usage analytics)
- Why data is collected (to provide AI features, improve services, personalize experience)

**Data Usage Section:**
- How data is used (AI processing, generating insights, synchronization)
- What data is processed in the cloud vs. on-device
- Any data sharing with third parties (integrations, analytics)

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Host on your primary domain (e.g., zuralog.app/privacy)
- Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- Link prominently in-app (Settings → Privacy)
- Update policy when adding new features or integrations
- Have legal counsel review for compliance
- Consider using a privacy policy generator specialized for health apps

### 1.8 Support URL

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
A support URL is required for both app stores. This is where users go when they have questions or encounter problems. The support channel significantly impacts app store ratings—users who cannot get help often leave negative reviews.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
For a health app, support is particularly important because users may have questions about data sync, privacy, or integration issues. Consider these support options:

**Minimum Viable Support:**
- FAQ page addressing common questions
- Contact form or email for specific issues
- Clear response time expectations (e.g., "We respond within 24 hours")

**Enhanced Support (for launch):**
- In-app support chat or form
- Community forum or knowledge base
- Status page for integration uptime
- Social media support handles

**Health-Specific Support Content:**
- How to troubleshoot HealthKit permissions

- Include your support email or contact form
- Track support tickets to identify product issues
- Consider Zendesk, Intercom, or Freshdesk for scaling

### 1.9 App Category Selected

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
Choosing the right category helps users find your app and affects competitive positioning. Apple allows one primary category and one secondary category. Google Play allows one primary category. Categories also affect algorithmic ranking and featured placement eligibility.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
For Zuralog, the category selection requires balancing multiple relevant options:

**Primary Category Options:**

1. **Health & Fitness** — Most direct fit, largest addressable audience
2. **Medical** — Would increase scrutiny but signals credibility (usually for clinical apps)
3. **Lifestyle** — Broader but less targeted

**Recommended Selection:**
- **Primary:** Health & Fitness (iOS and Android)
- **Secondary (iOS only):** Utilities or Lifestyle

**Alternative Strategy:**  
If Zuralog's AI capabilities are the differentiator, consider emphasizing the "productivity" or "utilities" aspects. However, the Health & Fitness category is most appropriate for the core value proposition.

**Subcategories (if available):**
- iOS: Health & Fitness → Health, Fitness, Medical (limited availability)
- Android: Health & Fitness → Health & Fitness (broader category only)

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Research competitor category placements
- Consider A/B testing category if platform supports
- Ensure category aligns with store guidelines for health apps
- Note that some categories trigger additional review requirements

### 1.10 Age Rating Completed

**Status:** ☐ Not Started  
**Priority:** Critical

**Description:**  
Age rating is required for both stores and affects content visibility, parental controls, and regulatory compliance. Apple uses a questionnaire; Google Play allows self-declaration. The rating must accurately reflect content to avoid removal or rating changes.

**Zuralog-Specific Guidance:**  
For Zuralog, as a health and fitness application:

**Apple App Store:**
- Apple provides a questionnaire about content
- Health apps typically receive "4+" or "9+" ratings
- If discussing sensitive health topics, consider higher rating with appropriate content warnings

**Google Play:**
- Select "Everyone" as the target age group (most appropriate for general fitness)
- Complete the content rating questionnaire honestly
- Health apps may receive "Low maturity" or "All ages" labels

**Factors Affecting Rating:**
- Does the app contain mature themes? → No
- Does it reference alcohol, tobacco, or drugs? → No
- Is there user-generated content? → Possibly (chat logs stored locally)
- Does it include in-app purchases? → Yes (subscriptions)
- Is there scary or disturbing content? → No

**Implementation Notes:**  
- Be honest in ratings to avoid future issues
- Prepare for potential family sharing considerations
- If adding social features later, revisit ratings
